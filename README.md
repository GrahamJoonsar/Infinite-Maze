# Infinite-Maze
An infinite maze simulator in rust. Take a stroll!


This maze generation program isn't a fully optimized and developed maze generating algorithm, but more of an excuse to learn rust. Because of that reason, I want to notify any readers of my code that it is proabably not best preactice or particularily efficient, but this is how I am going to leave it, or until I get better at rust and can fix it.
